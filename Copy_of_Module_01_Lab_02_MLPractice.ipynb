        "More Iterations (Higher k): Using a higher number of iterations, such as a larger k in k-fold cross-validation, can provide a more stable and robust estimate of model performance.

It's essential to strike a balance based on the size of your dataset and available computational resources. Common choices for k include 5, 10, or even 10-fold cross-validation.\n",

        "Advantages of Increasing Iterations: More iterations in cross-validation mean that you'll have multiple chances to assess your model's performance with different data splits. This can help in obtaining a more stable estimate of performance, even when dealing with small datasets.\n",
        "Limitations of Small Datasets: Small datasets inherently have limited diversity and may not fully represent the underlying data distribution. No matter how many iterations you use, the fundamental limitation of a small dataset remains, and your model's performance may not generalize well to unseen data.\n",
        "Data Augmentation: In some cases, data augmentation techniques can be used to artificially increase the effective size of your training dataset. This can be especially helpful when dealing with small datasets, as it introduces variations in the data, making the model more robust.\n",
        "Regularization: Using regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can help mitigate overfitting when training on small datasets. These techniques encourage the model to have simpler weight configurations and may improve generalization.\n",
